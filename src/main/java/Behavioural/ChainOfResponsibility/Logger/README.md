# The Chain of Responsibility pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to send a command without knowing which object will receive and handle it. This pattern is useful when multiple objects can handle a request, but the handler isn't known in advance. It allows the request to be passed along a chain of potential handlers until one of them deals with it.
