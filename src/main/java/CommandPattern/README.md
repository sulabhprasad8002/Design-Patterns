# The Command pattern wraps a request into a standalone object that contains all the information related to the request.
# This transformation allows us to parameterize clients with queues, requests and operations. It allows us to support undoable operations.

# The key idea is to decouple the sender and receiver of a request by encapsulating the request as an object.
